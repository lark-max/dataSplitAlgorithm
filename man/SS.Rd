\description{
The Systematic stratified(SS) data splitting method is a semideterministic method,
in which every kth sample from a random starting point is selected to form the training,
testing, and validation data sets. In implementing systematic sampling in this study,
the data are first ordered along the output variable dimension in increasing order.
Then, the sampling interval is determined based on the training and testing data proportions specified by the user.
Thereafter, a starting point is randomly selected and training samples are drawn first, followed by the testing samples.
Finally, unsampled data are allocated to the validation set.
